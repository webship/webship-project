The Webship.co portal site was built on top of Drupal, as it has many options, tools, frameworks, and configuration management, which are needed in building solutions.

Helps in speeding up the work of having Functional Automated Acceptance Testing for products to ship websites in a swift way.

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer
installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:


To install the dev version of Webship 9.1.x run this command:
```
composer create-project webship/webship-project:9.1.x-dev WEBSITE_NAME --stability dev --no-interaction
```
