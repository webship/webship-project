# Webship Project

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project webship/webship-project:8.1.x-dev WEBSHIP_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME --stability dev --no-interaction
```
